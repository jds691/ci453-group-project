        <h2>What is Information Security?</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        Information security is the practice of protecting information by getting rid of any risks. 
        It protects personal information, financial information and sensitive information from unauthorised 
        access. It is built around three main objectives which are known as the CIA, these stand for:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Confidentiality - This means the information is not disclosed to unauthorised individuals.                </li>
           <li>
            Integrity - This is so that the information maintains accurate and unchanged.
            </li>
            <li>
                Availability - This allows anyone to access it at anytime it is needed.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <a id="risks">
        <h2>What dangers are there?</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
        There are many security issues that come with information security. These can include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Human error - People can make mistakes meaning information is at risk.</li>
        <li>Cyber threats - These can include phishing, hackers and malware.</li>
        <li>Having more and more mobile and internet of things (IoT) devices - This adds new security challenges 
            as these devices can be lost or stolen.
        </li>
        <li>Insider threats - Employees pose a risk as some may hold sensitive information.</li>
    </ul>
    <a id="prevention">
        <h2>How to stop these risks</h2>
    </a>
    <ul>
        <li>Training for employees - this means employees can identify threats and respond to them</li>
        <li>Encryption - this protects sensitive information when it is sent or received</li>
        <li>Firewalls - firewalls control access to computer networks and prevent unauthorised access to information</li>
        <li>Penetration testing - this can be used to identify vulnerabilities in an organisation's systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Although there are many ways to improve information security, there are also a lot of challenges that come with it.
        There are always new cyberthreats meaning the security you may already have will soon not be good enough and needs to constantly
         be improved. Intergrating security into businesses is complicated as it requires a lot of time to do it correctly and this can 
         often be rushed, meaning the business is more likely to have their security breached.
